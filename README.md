# Challenge 2, Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

In this project I attempted to make the most professional looking portfolio page that i could using a basic html skeleton and advanced CSS styling. The page uses a grid display and is broken into 4 sections of header, aside, main and footer, with the main being broken up into 4 grid areas each 1 representing 1 of the image cards. all code is original code, expect for the blockhead logo in the top left corner or the page, which is modified code from (https://redstapler.co/creating-3d-cube-with-pure-css/#:~:text=3D%20cube%20effect%20can%20be,to%20move%20the%20rotation%20fulcrum.). The drop down menu in the small screen break point will open upon click however none of the links work.

CSS code could use some cleaning up I think, feels a bit wet, but I'm definiety still just getting a feel for proper use of classes and ids.
